## Final words

It was a good opportunity. I did the simple and the basic.
I first thought about creating a clean and fully organised folder structure. In the end, I couldn’t do this as the time was passing and there was a lot of things to do.
Creating games is like this, looks like there is always something to do, but I enjoyed it.
I preferred an event-based architecture because its cleaner and less decoupled, I also tried to create a good useCase system, to avoid weird behaviours after deaths, movements and other actions made by the player.
I liked what I did in this short time, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do. I did well, but I can do more.
